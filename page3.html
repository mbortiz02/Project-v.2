                The housing crisis is an everlasting problem in Brazil leaving 1.2 million Brazilians in either unsanitary housing conditions or homeless. This crisis is caused by rising land costs from Brazil's involvement in globalization and industrialization.
                The majority of the homeless are centered around living near the major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and come from low-income families. In addition to rising land costs, the number of low-income housing from 2013 to 2016 has seen a drastic decrease by 500,000 units in favor of high-income buyers.
                <br><br>
                São Paulo's rate of homelessness is rapidly growing at 2%-3% per year alongside a growing urban population and demand for housing. About 67% of Brazil's homeless are predominantly Black as the country suffers from a history of employing discriminatory laws against Black people.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                About 6,000 of Brazil's homeless people are below the age of 17 and a third of them are below the age of 5. Not just adults but children are affected by this housing crisis. These people who are forced to live on the streets deal with violence, cold, hunger, and poor hygiene on a day-to-day basis.
                Many of these children may experience firsthand trauma of domestic abuse or feel neglected by their family. Their families lack a stable income that can support their needs and rent costs, and could not keep up with the struggling economy. As they live in the more populated cities, they have to find some place indoors to sleep for the night or sleep on the streets. Despite a rough upbringing of delayed physical and psychological development, they remain resilient and determined to make it out the streets.
                <br><br>
                Brazil's economic policies remain inefficient and fail to address the severity of the housing crisis. They fall short of properly adjusting to the change in urbanization and industrialization.

                While the problem of homelessness persists, there have been attempts to tackle this issue. Starting in 2009, the Brazilian government began a housing program for low-income Brazilians that housed over 10 million Brazilians. Though the program has received major cuts in 2016, it provided help for those who were fortunate enough to receive it. In December 2023, a one billion Brazilian real plan was launched and designed to provide food, healthcare, and housing for the homeless. The plan includes campaigns against discriminating homeless people, and providing jobs to the homeless.
                <br><br>
                Other campaigns, such as Rio Invisível, have spread awareness on the housing crisis and have rallied people to advocate new changes and laws in assisting the homeless. In more recent years, Brazil's Federal Supreme Court made a move on decriminalizing homelessness and demonstrating its viewpoint on housing being a basic right.
